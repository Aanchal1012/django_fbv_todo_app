This is a small runbook created while learning and making this project

1) Install django if not already done use command : "python -m pip install django"

2) Create a new django project by running the command : "django-admin startproject todo"
    a) this should create a new folder with the name todo,
    b) Within this folder we have all the files needed for a django app.

3) The project structure should be like this,
├── todo
    ├── todo
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    └── manage.py

    a) todo/ -is the external folder of your project. It doesn’t matter to Django, so we can actually rename
        it to whatever we want.
    b) todo/todo/ -is the actual Django project folder. It contains the setting files of the project.
    c) manage.py -is a Python script with the same functionality of django_admin but our your project’s settings.
    d) __init__.py -makes todo/todo a Python package.
    e) settings.py -is the core file of the project. We can add, modify, or delete variables to change the behavior of
        our project.
    f) urls.py -is the file that defines the URLs of our project.
    g) asgi.py and wsgi.py let you deploy our project to a server.

4) To check if the app is created successfully or not, run the command : "python3 manage.py runserver" , make sure to
   go in the todo directory since that's where the manage.py file is

5) Time to create what we want in this todo app project. What do i want it to do for now?
    a) let me add a new task
    b) list all existing task
    c) update an already existing task
    d) delete a task
6) In order to do this, we need a another app within the todo app, lets call it tasks, do this by running the command:
   "python3 manage.py startapp tasks". This will create yet another folder inside todo app, the folder structure will
    have different files that will be used to do the CRUD operations.
